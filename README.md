üòî Two of the most awesome features of this laptop don't **yet** work: S3 sleep and audio. If you want to help, contact me!

## BIOS

I am on the currently (date: 11th Dec, 2021) latest available BIOS, which I installed using windows updates. It then flashed the firmware onto my device on a reboot. The exact version is: 1.11.1 11/18/2021. In order to have no complications, make sure you change these BIOS settings:

| Menu | Setting | State |
| ---- | ------- | ----- |
| Boot Configuration | Enable Secure Boot | Off |
| Pre-boot Behavior | Fastboot | Thorough |
| Integrated Devices | Thunderbolt Security Level | No Security |
| Storage | Sata Operation | AHCI |
| Power | Enable Lid Switch | On |
| Security | Intel Software Guard Extensions | Software Control |
| Power | Block Sleep | On |

Blocking sleep is just a bypass for now, I hope there's a fix down the road. I'll keep an eye on the topic.
